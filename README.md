# Companies that value Deep Work

This repo shows a list of companies that endorse Cal Newport's Deep Work approach. It might be a handy information for people who like to build stuff without intermittent, cheap, and noisy interruptions.

Contributions are welcome.

## Wait, what is Deep Work?

Cal Newport wrote a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Cal-Newport-audiobook/dp/B0189PVAWY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=deep+work&qid=1600695114&sr=8-1) about Deep Work in 2016. However, he started to discuss the concept years before on his blog.

In 2012, he defined Deep Work as a: _"Professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.”_ 

Some concepts are easier to understand with their contrast. Shallow work is the opposite idea of Deep wok and is defined as: _“Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create new value in the world and are easy to replicate.”_
